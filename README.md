# Metaprogramming Lecture Notes

These are the original notes from [the course Metaprogramming](https://github.com/namin/metaprogramming) given at the University of Cambridge, UK in 2018.

I am revisiting these notes to incorporate in my teaching of [CS1520 at Harvard](http://cs152.namin.net) and [metaprogramming lectures at OPLSS in 2025](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer25/topics.php).
