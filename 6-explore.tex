\section{Further Reading}

Examples of relaxing from symbolic to neural include Differentiable Forth~\citep{diffForth} and Differentiable ILP (Inductive Logic Programming)~\citep{diffILP}.
My own explorations of relaxed machines are at \url{https://github.com/namin/relaxed-machines}

Janus~\citep{janus} is a language for exploring reversible computing.
